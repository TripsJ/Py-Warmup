** Instructions
Goal: Write a Text analysis program that analyses a string of numbers

- ask the User for Text
- Count Symbols, Words and the number of occurences of each letter
- Return the results

  
** Get Input from User
This part should get a string of text from the user and verify that it is actually text and not untreatable.

#+begin_src python
  def check_text():
      intext = input("Get me some text to analyze: ")
      if intext.isascii():
          return intext
      else:
          raise ValueError
#+end_src

=String.isascii()= makes sure the inputed text is entierly contained in the ascii table, as this is what we will be checking against. If it is not Ascii, the function will raise a =ValueError= that we will use to except later.
